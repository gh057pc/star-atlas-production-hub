## üéØ How to Use

### 1. Get Your Inventory Data
- Visit [atlas.eveeye.com](https://atlas.eveeye.com/)
- Export or copy your Star Atlas inventory as CSV format
- The CSV should include columns: `Item`, `Total Units`, `USDC Value`, and location data

### 2. Select Contract & Location
- Choose your desired contract from the dropdown
- Set the quantity you want to craft (default: 100)
- Select your crafting location (default: MRZ-6)

### 3. Load Your Inventory
- **Paste Method**: Copy your CSV data and paste it into the text area
- **File Upload**: Upload your CSV file directly
- The app will automatically parse and process your inventory

### 4. Track Progress
- Progress bars automatically generate showing:
  - **Raw Materials**: Basic resources needed for crafting
  - **Compound Materials**: Processed materials (graphene, polymer, etc.)
  - **Components**: Complex parts (electromagnets, particle accelerators)
  - **Data**: Survey data units required

### 5. Analyze Locations
- View material distribution across galactic hubs
- See percentage of materials available at your chosen location
- Optimize logistics and transport planning

## üé® Visual Features

- **Futuristic Dark Theme**: Sleek metal-inspired design with orange highlights
- **Color-Coded Materials**: Each resource has unique colors for easy identification
- **Glow Effects**: Resource names have subtle glow effects matching their material colors
- **Progress Visualization**: Segmented progress bars showing raw vs crafted material contributions
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **Pure Static Web App**: No server required, runs entirely in browser
- **CSV Processing**: Uses Papa Parse for robust CSV handling
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic recalculation when inventory changes
- **Material Mapping**: Comprehensive database of Star Atlas resources and recipes
